			<h1>Undergraduate Research</h1>
			<p>Throughout my time at LSU I have been fortunate to be an active member of four different research laboratories. Each of my advisers has provided me with crucial guidance in developing my skills as an effective researcher and scientist. As I have changed research groups over time due to an ever increasing understanding of my own research interests, each of the experiences have built upon each other in serendipitous ways.</p>
			
			<h2>Dr. Carol Friedland</h2>
			<p><small>Building Damage Assessment due to Natural Disasters (2011-2012)</small></p>
			<p>Dr. Friedland's research group in Construction Management was full of chances to learn new skills. My main assignment throughout my time with Dr. Friedland was to start development of an application that could help digitize the collection of building assessment data. While I did not complete the application's integration with the assessment database I did learn the basics of programming for Android in Java and got a demo application.</p>
