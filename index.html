			<h1>Undergraduate Research</h1>
			<p>Throughout my time at LSU I have been fortunate to be an active member of four different research laboratories. Each of my advisers has provided me with crucial guidance in developing my skills as an effective researcher and scientist. As I have changed research groups over time due to an ever increasing understanding of my own research interests, each of the experiences have built upon each other in serendipitous ways.</p>
			
			<h2>Dr. Carol Friedland</h2>
			<p><small>Building Damage Assessment due to Natural Disasters (2011-2012)</small></p>
			<p>Dr. Friedland's research group in Construction Management was full of chances to learn new skills. My main assignment throughout my time with Dr. Friedland was to start development of an application that could help digitize the collection of building assessment data. While I did not complete the application's integration with the assessment database I did learn the basics of programming for Android in Java and got a demo application.</p>

			<h2>Dr. Todd Monroe</h2>
			<p><small>Fabrication and Testing of Biomedical Microfluidic Devices</small></p>

			<h2>Dr. Les Butler</h3>
			<p><small>X-Ray and neutron tomography data visualization and processing, big data processing work flow development, X-Ray interferometer design and fabrication, and NSF I-Corps business development of quality analysis software</small></p>
			<p>Through my work with Dr. Butler I have gotten multiple experiences to travel and meet with many professionals across the US and even internationally. Over spring break in 2014 myself and another undergraduate researcher flew to New York City to meet with collaborators at NYU Polytechnic in order to talk about the development of a software package VisTrails to be more customized for the research we were doing at LSU. In the fall of 2014 and spring of 2015 I was able to attend multiple conferences to present posters of my research or work flow development and equipment design. In June 2015 I went to Quebec City to present a poster at the International Conference on Materials Science and Tomography.
